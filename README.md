# Gimme 
is a philanthropy app where you can host randomized giveaways for people who can use the extra money. We were inspired by Bill Pulte and Mr. Beast, two famous (and wealthy individuals) who have spearheaded a philanthropy movement on Twitter
where they put money directly into the hands of people who need it the most. My team and I believed that it would be great
to build an app where people who are well off can donate money directly to people with a payment system integrated into
our app (we were unable to accomplish that part due to lack of time but we were planning on using Braintrees SDK). It is 
inspiring to see Bill Pulte and Mr. Beast inspire many other wealthy people to do the same as they are, 
so I wanted to work on a platform that would make it easier for people such as them to give more, especially during 
these difficult times.
